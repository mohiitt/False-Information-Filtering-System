# False Information Filtering System
The False Information Filtering System is a machine learning-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as "real" or "fake." The system utilizes a Passive Aggressive Classifier, trained on a dataset of labeled news articles, to predict the authenticity of a given news text.

The UI of the False Information Filtering System is built using Flask and HTML templates, providing an easy-to-use platform where users can input news articles and get real-time predictions regarding their authenticity (whether the news is real or fake).
