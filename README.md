# False Information Filtering System
The False Information Filtering System is a machine learning-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as "real" or "fake." The system utilizes a Passive Aggressive Classifier, trained on a dataset of labeled news articles, to predict the authenticity of a given news text.
